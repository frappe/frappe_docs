# Hooks

Hooks allow you to "hook" into functionality and events of core parts of the
Frappe Framework. This page documents all of the hooks provided by the framework.

> Jump to list of all [available hooks](#list-of-available-hooks) in Frappe.

## How does hooks work?

Hooks are places in the core code that allow an app to override the standard
implementation or extend it. Hooks are defined in **hooks.py** of your app.

Let's learn by example. Add the following hooks in your app's **hooks.py**.

```py
test_string = 'value'
test_list = ['value']
test_dict = {
	'key': 'value'
}
```

Now, open the python console by running the command `bench --site sitename
console` and run the following lines:

```sh
❯ bench --site sitename console
Apps in this namespace:
frappe, frappe_docs

In [1]: frappe.get_hooks('test_string')
Out[1]: ['value']

In [2]: frappe.get_hooks('test_dict')
Out[2]: {'key': ['value']}

In [3]: frappe.get_hooks('test_list')
Out[3]: ['value']
```

When you call `frappe.get_hooks`, it will convert all the values in a list. This
means that if the hook is defined in multiple apps, the values will be collected
from those apps. This is what enables the cascading nature of hooks.

Now, the hook value can be consumed in different ways. For example, for
including JS assets using `app_include_js`, all of the values are included. But
for overriding whitelisted method, the last value in the list is used.

So the implementation of the hook is totally dependent on how the author of the
feature intended it to be used.

## App Meta Data

These are automatically generated when you create a new app. Most of the time you
don't need to change anything here.

1. `app_name` - slugified name of the app
2. `app_title` - presentable app name
3. `app_publisher`
4. `app_description`
5. `app_version`
6. `app_icon`
7. `app_color`

## Javascript / CSS Assets

The following hooks allow you to inject static JS and CSS assets in various
 parts of your site.

### Desk

These hooks allow you to inject JS / CSS in `desk.html` which renders the
[Desk](/docs/user/en/desk).

```py
# injected in desk.html
app_include_js = "assets/js/app.min.js"
app_include_css = "assets/js/app.min.css"

# All of the above support a list of paths too
app_include_js = ["assets/js/app1.min.js", "assets/js/app2.min.js"]
```

### Portal

These hooks allow you to inject JS / CSS in `web.html` which renders the
[Portal](/docs/user/en/portal-pages).

```py
# injected in the web.html
web_include_js = "assets/js/app-web.min.js"
web_include_css = "assets/js/app-web.min.css"
# All of the above support a list of paths too
web_include_js = ["assets/js/web1.min.js", "assets/js/web2.min.js"]
```

### Web Form

These hooks allow you to add inject static JS and CSS assets in `web_form.html`
which is used to render Web Forms. These will work only for Standard Web Forms.

```py
webform_include_js = {"ToDo": "public/js/custom_todo.js"}
webform_include_css = {"ToDo": "public/css/custom_todo.css"}
```

> For user created Web Forms, you can directly write the script in the form
> itself.

### Page

These hooks allow you to inject JS assets in Standard Desk Pages.

```py
page_js = {"page_name" : "public/js/file.js"}
```

For e.g., Background Jobs is a standard page that is part of Core module in
Frappe Framework. To add custom behaviour in that page you can add a JS file in
your custom app `custom_app/public/js/custom_background_jobs.js` and add the
following line in your hooks file.

**custom_app/hooks.py**
```py
page_js = {"background_jobs": "public/js/custom_background_jobs.js"}
```

## Sounds

Frappe ships with a set of audio notifications for events like a success action,
document submission, error, etc. You can add your own sounds using the `sounds`
hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
sounds = [
	{'name': 'ping', 'src': '/assets/app/sounds/ping.mp3', 'volume': 0.2}
]
```

You can play your added sound using the client utility method:

```js
frappe.utils.play_sound('ping')
```

## Install Hooks

These hooks allow you to run code before and after installation of your app. For
example, [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) has these
[defined](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/hooks.py#L37-L38).

```py
# python module path
before_install = "app.setup.install.before_install"
after_install = "app.setup.install.after_install"
after_sync = 'app.setup.install.after_sync"
```

**app/setup/install.py**
```py
# will run before app is installed on site
def before_install():
	pass

# will run after app is installed on site
def after_install():
	pass

# will run after app fixtures are synced
def after_sync():
	pass
```

## Migrate Hooks

These hooks allow you to run code before and after a  migration is run on your
site via the command `bench --site sitename migrate`.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
before_migrate = "app.migrate.before_migrate"
after_migrate = "app.migrate.after_migrate"
```

**app/migrate.py**
```py
def after_migrate():
	# run code after site migration
	pass
```

## Test Hooks

This hook allows you to run code before tests are run on a site. You can use
this hook to add seed data to your database which will be available to your
tests.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
before_tests = "app.tests.before_tests"
```

**app/migrate.py**
```py
def before_tests():
	# add seed data to the database
	pass
```

## File Hooks

These hooks allows you to change the implementation of handling user uploaded
files.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
before_write_file = "app.overrides.file.before_write"
write_file = "app.overrides.file.write_file"
delete_file_data_content = "app.overrides.file.delete_file"
```

**app/overrides/file.py**
```py
# will run before file is written to disk
def before_write():
	pass

# will override the implementation of writing file to disk
# can be used to upload files to a CDN instead of writing
# the file to disk
def write_file():
	pass


# will override the implementation of deleting file from disk
# can be used to delete uploaded files from a CDN instead of
# deleting file from disk
def delete_file():
	pass
```

## Extend Bootinfo

After a successful login, the Desk is injected with a dictionary of global
values called `bootinfo`. The `bootinfo` is available as a global object in
Javascript as `frappe.boot`.

The `bootinfo` dict contains a lot of values including:

- System defaults
- Notification status
- Permissions
- User settings
- Language and timezone info

You can add global values that makes sense for your app via the `extend_bootinfo`
hook.

```py
# python module path
extend_bootinfo = "app.boot.boot_session"
```

The method is called with one argument `bootinfo`, on which you can directly
add/update values.

**app/boot.py**

```py
def boot_session(bootinfo):
	bootinfo.my_global_key = 'my_global_value'
```

Now, you can access the value anywhere in your client side code.
```js
console.log(frappe.boot.my_global_key)
```

## Website Context

When a Portal Page is rendered, a dictionary is built with all of the possible
variables that the page might need to render. This dict is also known as
`context`. You can use these hooks to add or modify values in this dict.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
website_context = {
	"favicon": "/assets/app/image/favicon.png"
}
update_website_context = 'app.overrides.website_context`
```

The `website_context` hook is a simple dict of key value pairs. Use this hook
for simple value overrides.

You can use the `update_website_context` hook for more complex scenarios as it
allows you to manipulate the context dict in a python method. The method is
called with one argument, which is the `context` dict. You can either modify the
context directly by mutating it or return a dict that will be merged with
`context`.

**app/overrides.py**
```py
def website_context(context):
	context.my_key = 'my_value'
```

## Website Controller Context

Frappe ships with standard web pages like `/404` and `/about`. If you want to
extend the controller context for these pages you can use the
`extend_website_page_controller_context` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
extend_website_page_controller_context = {
	'frappe.www.404': 'app.pages.context_404`
}
```

The above hook configuration will allow you to extend the context of the 404
page so that you can add your own keys or modify existing ones.

**app/pages.py**
```py
def context_404(context):
	# context of the 404 page
	context.my_key = 'my_value'
```

## Website Clear Cache

Frappe Framework caches a lot of static web pages for fast subsequent rendering.
If you have created web pages that use cached values, and you want to invalidate
the cache, this hook is place to do it.

**app/hooks.py**

```py
website_clear_cache = 'app.overrides.clear_website_cache'
```

The method is called with one argument `path`. `path` is set when cache is being
cleared for one route, and is `None` when cache is cleared for all routes. You
need to handle this case if your cache is page specific.

**app/overrides.py**
```py
def clear_website_cache(path=None):
	if path:
		# clear page related cache
	else:
		# clear all cache
```

## Website Redirects

Website Redirects allow you to define redirects from one route to another.
Frappe will generate a 304 Redirect response when the source URL is requested
and redirect to the target URL. You can redirect plain URLs or you can use regex
to match your URLs.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
website_redirects = [
	{"source": "/compare", "target": "/comparison"},
	{"source": "/docs(/.*)?", "target": "https://docs.tennismart.com/\1"},
]
```

The above configuration will result in following redirects:

- `/compare` to `/comparison`
- `/docs/getting-started` to `https://docs.tennismart.com/getting-started`
- `/docs/help` to `https://docs.tennismart.com/help`

## Website Route Rules

Website Route Rules allow you to map URLs to custom controllers. This is
commonly used to generate clean URLs for pages.

Let's say you want to have `/projects` route to display list of projects. This
can be done by creating a `projects.html` and `projects.py` in `www` folder.

You also want to have `/project/<name>` route to show a project page where name
is the dynamic. To do this you can use the `website_route_rules` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
website_route_rules = [
	{"from_route": "/projects/<name>", "to_route": "app/projects/project"},
]
```

Now, you can create your controller files in `app/projects` folder.

**app/projects/project.py**
```py
def get_context(context):
	project_name = frappe.form_dict.name
	project = frappe.get_doc('Project', project_name)
	context.project = project
```

**app/projects/project.html**
{% raw %}
```html
<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
<p>{{ project.description }}</p>
```
{% endraw %}

## Website 404

Frappe renders a default `/404` route when a page is not found. You can change
this using the `website_catch_all` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
website_catch_all = 'not_found'
```

The above configuration will render `/not_found` when a 404 is occurred. It is
upto you to implement the template `www/not_found.html` and controller
`www/not_found.py`.

## Default Homepage

Homepage is the page which is rendered when you visit the root URL (`/`) of your
site. There are multiple ways to configure what page is rendered as the default
homepage.

By default, the homepage is `index`. So, frappe will try to render `index.html`
from `www` folder. This can be overridden using the `homepage` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
homepage = "homepage"
```

The above configuration will load the `www/homepage.html` as the default
homepage.

You can also have role based homepage by using the `role_home_page` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
role_home_page = {
	"Customer": "orders",
	"Supplier": "bills"
}
```

The above configuration will make `/orders` the default homepage for users with
the **Customer** role and `/bills` for users with the **Supplier** role.

You can have even more control over the logic by using the
`get_website_user_home_page` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
get_website_user_home_page = "app.website.get_home_page"
```

**app/website.py**
```py
def get_home_page(user):
	if is_projects_user(user):
		return 'projects'
	if is_partner(user):
		return 'partner-dashboard'
	return 'index'
```

> If all of these hooks are defined, the `get_website_user_home_page` will have
> higher priority over the others, and `role_home_page` will have higher
> priority over `homepage`.

## Portal Sidebar

Some Portal views are shown with a sidebar with links to quickly jump to pages.
These sidebar items can be customized via hooks.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
portal_menu_items = [
	{"title": "Dashboard", "route": "/dashboard", "role": "Customer"},
	{"title": "Orders", "route": "/orders", "role": "Customer"},
]
```

The above configuration will add two sidebar links for users with the role
Customer.

![Portal Sidebar](/docs/assets/img/hooks-portal-menu-items.png)

These sidebar items are hardcoded in your app so they are not customizable from
Desk. For e.g., if you want to hide a sidebar link temporarily you will have to
make changes in your code.

There is another hook called `standard_portal_menu_items` which allows you to do
that. The sidebar links set in `standard_portal_menu_items` hook will be synced
with the database.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
standard_portal_menu_items = [
	{"title": "Dashboard", "route": "/dashboard", "role": "Website Manager"},
	{"title": "Orders", "route": "/orders", "role": "Website Manager"},
]
```

The above configuration will sync sidebar items to the Portal Settings which can
later be edited by any System User.

![Portal Settings](/docs/assets/img/hooks-standard-portal-menu-items.png)

## Brand HTML

This hook allows you to customize the brand logo in the navbar of your website.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
brand_html = '<div><img src="tennismart.png"> TennisMart</div>'
```

If the `brand_html` is defined, it will override the default brand html in the
navbar. It is not recommended to use hooks to change your brand logo, unless you
want to version control it, otherwise you can use Website Settings to change it.

## Base Template

When a web page is rendered, it extends `templates/base.html` by default. You
can override the base template by overriding the `base_template` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
base_template = 'app/templates/my_custom_base.html`
```

You can also customize base templates based on routes. For e.g., if you want to
use a different base template for all the routes that start with `docs/*` then
you can use the `base_template_map` hook. The key must be a regex that matches
the route. All other routes will fallback to the default base template.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
base_template_map = {
	r"docs.*": "app/templates/doc_template.html"
}
```

## Integrations

These hooks allow you to customize behaviour of 3rd-party integrations in
Frappe.

### Braintree Success Page

This hook allows you to override the default redirect URL on successful payment
of Braintree transaction.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
braintree_success_page = "app.integrations.braintree_success_page"
```

The method is called with one argument `data` which has the meta data of the
payment.

**app/integrations.py**
```py
def braintree_success_page(data):
	# data.reference_doctype
	# data.reference_docname
	return '/thank-you'
```

## Calendars

The calendar hook is a list of doctype names which are shown as menu items for
quick navigation from the Calendar page in Desk.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
calendars = ["Appointment"]
```

![Event Menu Shortcuts](/docs/assets/img/hooks-event-menu-shortcuts.png)

## Clear Cache

This hook allows you to clear your app specific cache values when the global
cache is being cleared by frappe.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
clear_cache = "app.cache.clear_cache"
```

You can use this hook to clear your app specific cache. The method is called
without any arguments.

**app/cache.py**
```py
def clear_cache():
	frappe.cache().hdel('app_specific_cache')
```

## Default Mail Footer

If you want to set the default footer of all the emails that are sent out by
Frappe, you can use the `default_mail_footer` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
default_mail_footer = """
	<div>
		Sent via <a href="https://tennismart.com" target="_blank">TennisMart</a>
	</div>
"""
```

Now, all the emails will have **Sent via TennisMart** in the footer.

## Session Hooks

These hooks are triggered over the login lifecycle of a user. `on_login` is
triggered immediately after a successful login, `on_session_creation` is
triggered after the session is setup, `on_logout` is triggered after the user
logs out.

**app/hooks.py**

```py
on_login = 'app.overrides.successful_login'
on_session_creation = 'app.overrides.allocate_free_credits'
on_logout = 'app.overrides.clear_user_cache'
```

The method will be called with one argument
[`login_manager`](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/develop/frappe/auth.py#L98).

**app/overrides.py**
```py
def allocate_free_credits(login_manager):
	# allocate free credits to frappe.session.user
	pass
```

## Fixtures

Fixtures are database records that are synced using JSON files when you install
and update your site.

Let's say you want to create a set of categories in the database whenever you
install your app. To do that, create the set of categories in your local site,
and add the doctype name in the `fixtures` hook.

```py
fixtures = [
	# export all records from the Category table
	"Category"
]
```

Now, run the following command:

```sh
bench --site sitename export-fixtures
```

This command will create a JSON file for each doctype which will contain the
data to generate list of records. You can test this by creating a new site and
by installing your app on that site.

You can also add conditions for exporting records.
```py
fixtures = [
	# export all records from the Category table
	"Category",
	# export only those records that match the filters from the Category table
	{"dt": "Role", "filters": [["role_name", "like", "Admin%"]]},
]
```



## Document Hooks

### Modify List Query

You can customize how list of records are queried for a DocType by adding custom
match conditions using the `permission_query_conditions` hook. This match
condition must be a valid WHERE clause fragment for an SQL query.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
permission_query_conditions = {
	"ToDo": "app.permissions.todo_query",
}
```
The method is called with a single argument `user` which can be `None`. The
method should return a string that is a valid SQL WHERE clause.

**app/permissions.py**
```py
def todo_query(user):
	if not user:
		user = frappe.session.user
	# todos that belong to user or assigned by user
	return "(`tabToDo`.owner = {user} or `tabToDo`.assigned_by = {user})".format(user=frappe.db.escape(user))
```

Now, if you use the `frappe.db.get_list` method, your WHERE clause will be
appended to the query.
```py
todos = frappe.db.get_list('ToDo', debug=1)

# output
'''
select `tabToDo`.`name`
from `tabToDo`
where ((`tabToDo`.owner = 'john@doe.com' or `tabToDo`.assigned_by = 'john@doe.com'))
order by `tabToDo`.`modified` DESC
'''
```

> This hook will only affect the result of `frappe.db.get_list` method and not
> `frappe.db.get_all`.

### Document Permissions

You can modify the behaviour of `doc.has_permission` document method for any
DocType and add custom permission checking logic using the `has_permission`
hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
has_permission = {
	"Event": "app.permissions.event_has_permission",
}
```

The method will be passed the `doc`, `user` and `permission_type` as arguments.
It should return `True` or a `False` value. If `None` is returned, it will
fallback to default behaviour.

**app/permissions.py**
```py
def event_has_permission(doc, user=None, permission_type=None):
	# when reading a document allow if event is Public
	if permission_type == "read" and doc.event_type == "Public":
		return True

	# when writing a document allow if event owned by user
	if permission_type == "write" and doc.owner == user:
		return True

	return False
```

### Override DocType Class

You can override/extend the class for standard doctypes by using the
`override_doctype_class` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
override_doctype_class = {
	'ToDo': 'app.overrides.todo.CustomToDo'
}
```

**app/overrides/todo.py**
```py
from frappe.desk.doctype.todo.todo import ToDo

class CustomToDo(ToDo):
	def on_update(self):
		self.my_custom_code()
		super(ToDo, self).on_update()

	def my_custom_code(self):
		pass
```

> It is recommended that you extend the standard class of the doctype, otherwise
> you will have to implement all of the core functionality.

### CRUD Events

You can hook into various CRUD events of any doctype using the `doc_events`
hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
doc_events = {
	"*": {
		# will run after any DocType record is inserted into database
		"after_insert": "app.crud_events.after_insert_all"
	},
	"ToDo": {
		# will run before a ToDo record is inserted into database
		"before_insert": "app.crud_events.before_insert_todo",
	}
}
```

The method will be passed the doc and the method name as arguments.

**app/crud_events.py**
```py
def after_insert_all(doc, method=None):
	pass

def before_insert_todo(doc, method=None):
	pass
```

> See [Controller Hooks](/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/controllers#controller-hooks)
> for a list of all available hooks.

### Override Whitelisted Methods

Whitelisted Methods are python methods that are accessible on a REST endpoint
and consumed by a client. You can override standard whitelisted methods that are
part of the core framework using the `override_whitelisted_methods` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
override_whitelisted_methods = {
	"frappe.client.get_count": "app.whitelisted.custom_get_count"
}
```

The method should have the same signature as the original method.

**app/whitelisted.py**
```py
def custom_get_count(doctype, filters=None, debug=False, cache=False):
    # your custom implementation of the standard get_count method provided by frappe
    pass
```

### Form Timeline

The timeline section of [form view](/docs/user/en/desk#form-view) of a document
shows an audit trail of actions performed on that document like views, value
changes, comments and related communications, etc.

Apart from these standard actions, there might arise a situation where you need
to add your own custom actions. You can do this via
`additional_timeline_content` hook.

```py
additional_timeline_content: {
	# show in each document's timeline
	'*': ['app.timeline.all_timeline']
	# only show in ToDo's timeline
	'ToDo': ['app.timeline.todo_timeline']
}
```

The method will be passed the doctype and docname as arguments. You can perform
queries and return actions related to that document as a list of dicts as shown
in the example. Each dict in the list must have a `creation` value which will be
used to sort the item in the timeline.

```py
def todo_timeline(doctype, docname):
	# this method should return a list of dicts
	return [
		{
			 # this will be used to sort the content in the timeline
			'creation': '22-05-2020 18:00:00'
			# this JS template will be rendered in the timeline
			'template': 'custom_timeline_template'
			# this data will be passed to the template.
			'template_data': {'key': 'value'}
		},
		...
	]
```

## Scheduler Events

You can use Scheduler Events for running tasks periodically in the background
using the `scheduler_events` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
scheduler_events = {
	"hourly": [
		# will run hourly
		"app.scheduled_tasks.update_database_usage"
	],
}
```

**app/scheduled_tasks.py**
```py
def update_database_usage():
	pass
```

### Available Events

- `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`

  These events will trigger every hour, day, week and month respectively.

- `hourly_long`, `daily_long`, `weekly_long`, `monthly_long`

  Same as above but these jobs are run in the [long
  worker](/docs/user/en/basics/directory-structure#worker_long) suitable for
  long running jobs.

- `all`

  The `all` event is triggered every 60 seconds. This can be configured
  via the `scheduler_tick_interval` key in
  [`common_site_config.json`](/docs/user/en/basics/sites#scheduler_tick_interval)

- `cron`

  A valid cron string that can be parsed by [croniter](https://pypi.org/project/croniter/).

Usage Examples:

```py
scheduler_events = {
	"daily": [
		"app.scheduled_tasks.manage_recurring_invoices"
	],
	"daily_long": [
		"app.scheduled_tasks..take_backups_daily"
	],
	"cron": {
		"15 18 * * *": [
			"app.scheduled_tasks..delete_all_barcodes_for_users"
		],
		"*/6 * * * *": [
			"app.scheduled_tasks..collect_error_snapshots"
		],
		"annual": [
			"app.scheduled_tasks.collect_error_snapshots"
		]
	}
}
```

## Jinja Customization

Frappe provides a list of [global utility methods](/docs/user/en/api/jinja) in
Jinja templates. To add your own methods and filters you can use the `jenv` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
jenv = {
	"methods": [
		"get_fullname:app.jinja.get_fullname"
	],
	"filters": [
		"format_currency:app.jinja.currency_filter"
	]
}
```

**app/jinja.py**

```py
def get_fullname(user):
	first_name, last_name = frappe.db.get_value('User', user, ['first_name', 'last_name'])
	return first_name + ' ' + last_name

def format_currency(value, currency):
	return currency + ' ' + str(value)
```

Now, you can use these utilities in your Jinja templates like so:

{% raw %}
```html
<h1>Hi, {{ get_fullname(frappe.session.user) }}</h1>
<p>Your account balance is {{ account_balance | format_currency('INR') }}</p>
```
{% endraw %}

## Prevent Auto Cancellation of Linked Documents

To prevent documents of a specific DocType from being automatically cancelled on
the cancellation of any linked documents you can use the
`auto_cancel_exempted_doctypes` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
auto_cancel_exempted_doctypes = ["Payment Entry"]
```

In the above example, if any document (for e.g Sales Invoice) that is linked
with Payment Entry is cancelled, it will skip the auto-cancellation of the
linked Payment Entry document.


## Notification configurations

The notification configuration hook is used to customize the items shown in the
Notification dropdown in Desk. It can be configured by the `notification_config`
hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
notification_config = 'app.notification.get_config'
```

The method is called without any arguments.

**app/notification.py**
```py
def get_config():
	return {
		"for_doctype": {
			"Issue": {"status":"Open"},
			"Issue": {"status":"Open"},
		},
		"for_module_doctypes": {
			"ToDo": "To Do",
			"Event": "Calendar",
			"Comment": "Messages"
		},
		"for_module": {
			"To Do": "frappe.core.notifications.get_things_todo",
			"Calendar": "frappe.core.notifications.get_todays_events",
			"Messages": "frappe.core.notifications.get_unread_messages"
		}
	}
```

The above configuration has three parts:

1. `for_doctype` part of the above configuration marks any "Issue"
	or "Customer Issue" as unread if its status is Open
2. `for_module_doctypes` maps doctypes to module's unread count.
3. `for_module` maps modules to functions to obtain its unread count. The
   functions are called without any argument.

## Required Apps

When building apps, you might create apps that build on top of other apps. To
make sure dependent apps are installed when someone installs your app, you can
use the `required_apps` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
```py
required_apps = ['erpnext']
```

The above configuration will make sure `erpnext` is installed when someone
installs your app.
