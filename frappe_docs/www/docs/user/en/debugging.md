# Debugging

## Server

When you run the `bench start` command during development, the log from each
process of the Procfile is logged in the terminal window.

```sh
▶ bench start

```

When you write any print statements in your python code, it will show up in the
`web:` process log if it is a request/response, or in one of `worker_` processes
if the code runs in a background job.

> If you are a VSCode user, you can debug right in your editor by setting
breakpoints in your code. Follow these
[steps](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/wiki/VSCode-Debugging-for-Frappe-Python)
to set it up.


### Logging

In case you're running production, you'd need logs all the more to keep track of as much information about your Frappe environment.

Out of the box, logs are stored under the `./logs` folder in your bench. From Frappe Version 13, logs are available at site level too, under `./sites/{site}/logs`.

These site logs are created by the Frappe Application, while many of the bench level log files are generated by the processes that support your Frappe environment. Checkout `Procfile` or `supervisor.conf` in your bench for more information.

> Learn more about Frappe Logs [here](/docs/user/en/logging) and the Frappe Logging API from [here](/docs/user/en/api/logging).


### Console

To play with Python API, bench provides an iPython shell. After you run the
following command, it will import frappe, initialize it and also connect to
database.

```sh
▶ bench --site [sitename] console

In [1]: frappe.get_doc('Task', 'TASK00004')
Out[1]: <erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task.Task at 0x10825d710>
```

> Learn more about the Python API [here](/docs/user/en/api/python).

### Profiling

Bench's `execute` command runs a dotted path to method and it also supports
profiling.

```sh
▶ bench --site [sitename] --profile execute erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task.set_tasks_as_overdue
```

You should be able to run most commands you can run via console with `execute` now, including *db* methods.

```sh
▶ bench --site [sitename] execute frappe.db.get_database_size
6784
```

### Monitoring

Monitor logs request and job metadata. To enable this feature set `monitor: 1` in `site_config.json` or `common_site_config.json`.

Collected data is buffered in redis cache and periodically moved to `monitor.json.log` file in `logs` directory with a scheduled job `frappe.monitor.flush`.

```JSON
{
    "duration": 807142,
    "request": {
        "ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/api/method/frappe.realtime.get_user_info",
        "response_length": 9687,
        "status_code": 500
    },
    "site": "frappe.local",
    "timestamp": "2020-03-05 09:37:17.397884",
    "transaction_type": "request",
    "uuid": "83be6a4c-27a1-497a-9ce6-c815bca4e420"
}
```

```JSON
{
    "duration": 1364,
    "job": {
        "method": "frappe.ping",
        "scheduled": false,
        "wait": 90204
    },
    "site": "frappe.local",
    "timestamp": "2020-03-05 09:37:40.124682",
    "transaction_type": "job",
    "uuid": "8225ab76-8bee-462c-b9fc-a556406b1ee7"
}
```

## Client

Client side debugging is as simple as adding a `debugger` statement in your JS
file. You must open your DevTools in your browser for it to pause on the statement.

```js
frappe.db.get_value('Task', 'TASK00004', 'status')
	.then(values => {
		debugger
		console.log(values);
	})
```

### Console

To play with Client API, you can open your browser's console and use the
globally available `frappe` object to explore and run methods and access
properties.
