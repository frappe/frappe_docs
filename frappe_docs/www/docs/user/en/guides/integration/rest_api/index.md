# Introduction

Frappe ships with an HTTP API that can be classified into *Remote Procedure Calls* (RPC), to call whitelisted methods and *Representational State Transfer* (REST), to manipulate resources.

The base URL is `https://{your frappe instance}`. Every request shown here should be added to the end of your base URL. For example, if your instance is `demo.erpnext.com`, `GET /api/resource/User` means `GET https://demo.erpnext.com/api/resource/User`.

## RPC

A request to an endpoint `/api/method/dotted.path.to.function` will call a whitelisted python function.

For example, `GET /api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user` will call [this function](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/28b909435320e3d6d1a3b2e7c02f286984dc39b3/frappe/auth.py#L347-L349) from frappe's auth module:

```python
@frappe.whitelist()
def get_logged_user():
	return frappe.session.user
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Administrator"
}
```

## REST

All documents in Frappe are available via a RESTful API with prefix `/api/resource/`. You can perform all CRUD operations on them:

* Create

	You can create a document by sending a `POST` request to the endpoint, `/api/resource/{doctype}`.

* Read

	You can get a document by its name using the endpoint, `/api/resource/{doctype}/{name}`

* Update

	You can update a document by sending a `PUT` request to the endpoint, `/api/resource/{doctype}/{name}`. This acts like a `PATCH` HTTP request in which you do not have to send the whole document but only the parts you want to change.

* Delete

	You can delete a document by its name by sending a `DELETE` request to the endpoint, `/api/resource/{doctype}/{name}`.
