    Overview of the out of the box logs in Frappe

# Logging

Logging events can significantly improve the debugging experience. Frappe's
development and production environments come with logging capabilities out of
the box.

There's two main categories of logs based on accessibility. Desk Logs, which are
stored in your site database and can be accessed and queried as Documents and
the Server Logs, that are stored in files managed by a Log Rotation system.


## Desk Logs

Logs that can be accessed via the Desk UI _(generally searched for, from the
[Awesomebar](/docs/user/en/desk#awesomebar))_. These track the operational
events generally; but you can utilize their APIs to track about anything from
your Frappe apps.

Some of the logs in the `Core` module are:

- [Access
  Log](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/access-log)
- [Activity Log](#activity-log)
- [Error
  Log](https://frappe.io/blog/development/better-error-logging-with-frappe)
- [Scheduled Job Log](#scheduled-job-log)


You can find more information about them from the embedded links. The best way
to find out more about each of them is checking them out directly on your site.


## Server Logs

Server Logs generally consist of lower level, transactional data as compared to
those accessible from Desk. From Version 13, logs are available at site level
too. These site logs are created by the Frappe Application, while many of the
bench level log files are generated by the processes that support your Frappe
environment. From your bench folder, you may find logs under:

- `./logs`
- `./sites/{site}/logs`

At the time of writing this, only `frappe.web.log` and `scheduler.log` are
logged at site and bench-level. At bench level, some of the most useful files
could be:

- `bench.log`
- `scheduler.log`
- `worker.log`

Tracking the bench commands executed, status of the jobs run by your Scheduler
or [Background
Jobs](/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/running-background-jobs) can be found
in these logs.

> To enable Frappe Web Logging on your site, update the site config with
> `enable_frappe_logger`: `true`

### Error Snapshots

Along with these, Frappe maintains error snapshots for your sites for HTTP
response codes from 500 and above. This is done in order to provide more context
for failures in case of server errors. Consider, a desk action failing with HTTP
status code 500, this would add a corresponding log in the
`./sites/{site}/frappe.log` file as follows:

```
2021-05-06 14:08:12,177 ERROR frappe New Exception collected with snapshot id: 2021-05-06 14:08:11.940809-127.0.0.1-bde
Site: frappeframework.com
Form Dict: {'docs': '{"name":"assets.frappeframework.com","owner":"Administrator","creation":"2020-04-04 14:58:18.771247","modified":"2021-02-08 09:40:56.820300","modified_by":"gavin@frappe.io","idx":0,"docstatus":0,"status":"Active","hostname":"assets","domain":"frappeframework.com","cluster":"Default","provider":"Generic","is_server_setup":1,"ip":"192.168.29.100","private_ip":"10.120.120.120","agent_password":"*****","is_primary":1,"doctype":"Server","__last_sync_on":"2021-05-06T08:38:08.931Z"}', 'method': 'ping_agent', 'cmd': 'run_doc_method'}
```

The first line of the log mentions the snapshot ID of the error, which in this
case was `2021-05-06 14:08:11.940809-127.0.0.1-bde`. A corresponding file
identified with the snapshot ID should be under
`./sites/frappeframework.com/error-snapshots`, with the name `2021-05-06
14:08:11.940809-127.0.0.1-bde.json`. Contents of the file may be:

    }
```

These snapshots are synced periodically with the site's database and are
available via the desk with records added under the DocType **Error Snapshot**. They
are maintained for a month from creation before each record is deleted.

> Error snapshots are tracked by default. To disable this for your site, update
> the site config with `disable_error_snapshot`: `true`

## Processes

Server Logs may be generated by the [bench CLI](/docs/user/en/tutorial/bench),
your process manager or the Frappe application directly. Your process managers
take care of getting all the moving parts up and running for your Frappe
environment as well as directing output and error streams to your log files.

Apart from the *"always running"* default logging, you can also use
[Monitor](/docs/user/en/debugging#monitoring) to log more information about all
the requests to your site.


## Maintainence

The log files generated by your process manager may get pretty large over time
if you aren't paying attention. To know which files you have to track for this,
checkout the `supervisor.conf` or `Procfile` on your bench, depending on whether
you're running a production or development instance respectively.


## More

In a production environment, you'd likely want to log more information for your
Frappe Applications or the processes that make up your Frappe Environment.
