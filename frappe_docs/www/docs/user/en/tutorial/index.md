# Frappe Framework Tutorial

In this guide, you will learn how to create a web application from scratch using
the Frappe Framework.

## Who is this for?

This guide is intended for software developers who are familiar with how web
applications are built. The Frappe Framework is powered by Python, JavaScript
and Redis, to name a few technologies and supports MariaDB and PostgreSQL
databases. Jinja is used as the templating engine for Web Views and Print
formats. Redis is used for caching, maintaing job queues and realtime updates.
However, you may not need to be proficient in all these tools to get started
with it.

Frappe Framework and the apps you build on it require `git` for version control
and update management via Bench. It is also expected that you are familiar with
basic git commands.

## What are we building?

We will build a simple **Library Management System** in which the **Librarian**
can log in and manage Articles and Memberships. We will build the following
models:

1. **Article:** A Book or similar item that can be rented.
2. **Library Member:** A user who is subscribed to a membership.
3. **Library Transaction:** An Issue or Return of an article.
4. **Library Membership:** A document that represents an active membership of a
   Library Member.
5. **Library Settings:** Settings that define values like Loan Period and
   the maximum number of articles that can be issued at a time.

The Librarian will log in to an interface known asÂ **Desk**, a rich admin
interface that ships with the framework. The Desk provides many standard views like
List view, Form view, Report view, etc, and many features like Role-based
Permissions.

We will also create public Web Views which can be accessed by the Library
Members where they can browse available Articles.
