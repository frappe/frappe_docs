# Developer API

Frappe aims to achieve a minimum cognitive load for its users. You'll find that most
common methods utilities can be found directly under the `frappe` namespace.

## Python Backend

It's the only import you'll need most of the time in a Python module.

## JavaScript Frontend

Frappe attaches itself to the `window` object under the `frappe` namespace. You
will find most of the Client API under the `frappe` object. All of these methods
are only available inside the Desk. A good way to explore these APIs is from the
browser console.
