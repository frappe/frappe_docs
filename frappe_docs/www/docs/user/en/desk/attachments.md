> Note: Hidden files (files starting with `.`) are not extracted when importing from a zip file.

## Limits

A limit of 10MB is applicable on file size per attachment by default. For self-hosted users, this can be changed by setting `max_file_size` in your site's configuration file.

### Attachments per Document

You can limit how many files can be attached to a specific document.

#### Step 1: Navigate to Customize Form

> Home > Customization > Customize Form

#### Step 2: Select Document Type

Select the document type for which you'd like to set this limit.

![Select Document Type](/docs/assets/img/select_document_type.png)

#### Step 3: Set Limit

Set the value of **Max Attachments** to the maximum number of attachments allowed for this document type.

![Set Limit](/docs/assets/img/set_max_attachments.png)

Once you're satisfied with the changes, click the **Update** button. That's it! The maximum number of attachments per document will now be validated every time a new attachment is added to a document of this type.
