# Reports

Frappe framework is best suited for business applications and reporting is an
important part of any business. Frappe supports 3 different ways to build
reports depending on their complexity.

Let's discuss each type and how to build them using Frappe.

1. [Report Builder](/docs/user/en/desk/reports/report-builder): Simple reports that are built from the Desk user interface.
1. [Query Report](/docs/user/en/desk/reports/query-report): Write Reports using SQL query
1. [Script Report](/docs/user/en/desk/reports/script-report): Write Reports using scripts

## Query Report View

For both Query Reports and Script Reports the same UI view is used to render
them. So, both of them benefit from the UI features like Print, PDF, Export to
Excel/CSV, Auto Email Report, etc.
