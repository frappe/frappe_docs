# Single DocType

A Single DocType is a DocType that has only one instance in the database. It is useful
for persisting things like *System Settings*, which don't make sense to have multiple
records.

```python
>>> settings = frappe.get_doc('System Settings')
>>> settings.notification_frequency
'Daily'
```

### Schema

Single DocTypes are stored in the `tabSingles` table in the database, with each property having its own record.

Columns:

- `doctype`
- `field`
- `value`
