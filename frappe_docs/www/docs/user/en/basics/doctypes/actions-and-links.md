## Actions and Links

> Added in Version 12.1

**Actions**

A DocType may also have `Daily Action` that will result in a button creation on the DocType View. Supported actions are:

1. **Server Action**: This will trigger a whitelisted server action.

**Links**

A standard navigation aid to the DocType view is the `Links` section on the dashboard. This helps the viewer identify at a glance which document types are connected to this DocType and can quickly create new related documents.
