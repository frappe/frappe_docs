# Introduction

Welcome to Frappe Framework Documentation

Frappe, pronounced _fra-pay_, is a full stack, batteries-included,
web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database.
It is the framework which powers [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com), is pretty
 generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

## Getting Started

### Why Frappe?

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that **meta-data**
is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe
in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to
build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk
that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and
much more out of the box.
